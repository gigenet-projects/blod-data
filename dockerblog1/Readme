*Docker Swarm*
--------------
The Ansible Inventory file should have a collection of servers, and workers:

[all]

[DockerSwarm:children]
DockerManagement
DockerNodes

[DockerManagement]
192.168.100.10
192.168.100.11

[DockerNodes]
192.168.100.12
192.168.100.13
192.168.100.14

The Ansible Playbook file should include following the playbook example in this git repository:

---
- hosts: DockerSwarm
  remote_user: root
  roles:
    - { role: docker, tags: ['install', 'manager', 'worker'] }


To run the Ansible Playbook you should run a command that is similiar to the following:

!]# ansible-playbook -i hosts docker.yml
